Nothing to see here yet.

When it's finished, it'll be a year 2010 compliant version of my self-destructing email solution I outlined back in 2002 on my old website at http://www.pilif.ch/stuff/adaddr/index.php

Back then, it was perl and plugging into your own mail server.

Now it's node.js and providing my own web application for creating aliases and mail server for handling incoming mail. This way, users are not required to run their own mail server.

Basically, this will be the same thing as the various throw-away-email-address-services out there with the exception that this will create a temporary alias that redirects incoming mail directly to your inbox instead of forcing you to go over some crappy (and ad filled) web interface.

This of course means that there isn't that much in ways of monetization, but thankfully, I don't require this to be profitable at all, but I'm using it as a nice way to learn node.js which, in turn, will give YOU, dear user, a superior service.

Please give me a couple of weeks to make this work though - this is my very first node.js code ever, so I expect a couple of pitfalls on the way
